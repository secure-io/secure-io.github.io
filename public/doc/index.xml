      <description>Secure I/O is an open-source project that provides provable secure authenticated encryption for data streams.
It has been developed because many widely used solutions for data encryption are not well-suited for streaming or cannot preserve important security guarantees.
Take a look at the FAQ to learn more about the limitations of classical encryption schemes.</description>

      <description>What does &amp;ldquo;provable secure&amp;rdquo; mean? TL;DR: The authenticated encryption scheme used by Secure I/O is secure if the underlying AEAD, e.g. AES-GCM, is secure.
In modern cryptography people often try to proof the security of algorithms or protocols. The advantage of a security proof is that you know - for sure - that the scheme guarantees certain security properties.
However, a security proof does neither mean that the scheme cannot be broken at all nor that it can be applied out of context.</description>
