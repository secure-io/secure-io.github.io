      <description>Secure I/O is an open-source project that provides provable secure authenticated encryption for I/O streams.
It is not a comprehensive cryptographic library. Instead, it is focused on one specific problem, i.e. encrypting data streams, and solves that in a provable secure way. Therefore, Secure I/O provides packages for various programming languages with an easy-to-use and idiomatic API for encrypting and decrypting I/O operations.
Supported Languages At the moment there are a packages for the following languages:</description>

      <description>Why should I use Secure I/O?   Actually, there are many different ways to encrypt data. For example, a block cipher, e.g. AES, in counter mode (CTR) has been and still is a quite popular encryption scheme. Even though, AES-CTR preserves the confidentiality of the encrypted data, it provides no integrity protection whatsoever. In particular, an attacker can flip a bit of the ciphertext and therefore, can cause a flip of the corresponding plaintext bit during decryption.</description>
