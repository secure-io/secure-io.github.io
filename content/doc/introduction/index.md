[Secure I/O](https://github.com/secure-io) is an open-source project that
provides provable secure authenticated encryption for data streams.

It has been developed because many widely used solutions for data encryption are not
well-suited for streaming or cannot preserve important security guarantees.

Take a look at the [FAQ](/doc/faq#why-should-i-use-secure-io) to learn more about
the limitations of classical encryption schemes.
